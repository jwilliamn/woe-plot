# The Weight of Evidence (WOE) plot 

This function is an alternative to the `woebin_plot` function from [scorecardpy](https://github.com/ShichenXie/scorecardpy/tree/master){target="_blank"} which does not have the option to plot on matplotlib axes.

In this function I added such functionality that plots directly to matplotlib axes, which is important(at least for me) to generate neatly reports for all features desired that are in your data.
